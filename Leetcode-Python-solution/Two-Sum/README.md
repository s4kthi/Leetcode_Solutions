# Two Sum - Beginner Friendly Explanation

## Problem Description

The **Two Sum** problem is a common algorithmic challenge that asks:

> Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to the `target`.

- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
- You cannot use the same element twice.
- Return the indices in any order.

## Example

### Input:
```plaintext
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
```

### Output:
```plaintext
[0, 1]
```

### Explanation:
The numbers `2` and `7` add up to `9`. Their indices are `0` and `1`, respectively.

## Solution Explanation

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution using Python:

### Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        m = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            x = target - num
            if x in m:
                return [m[x], i]
            else:
                m[num] = i
        return [-1, -1]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a dictionary `m` to store the value of elements as the key and their indices as the value.

2. **Iterate Through Array**:
   - For each element in the array, calculate the difference between the `target` and the current number (`x = target - num`).
   - Check if this difference (`x`) already exists in the dictionary.

3. **Check for Match**:
   - If `x` exists in the dictionary, weâ€™ve found the two numbers. Return their indices.

4. **Update the Dictionary**:
   - If `x` doesnâ€™t exist, store the current number and its index in the dictionary for future reference.

5. **Return Default**:
   - If no pair is found (though the problem guarantees a solution), return `[-1, -1]`.

## Key Concepts

1. **Dictionary for Quick Lookup**:
   - A dictionary allows constant-time complexity to check for the existence of an element.

2. **Efficient Approach**:
   - This solution avoids nested loops by using the dictionary, making it faster with a time complexity of **O(n)**.

## Example Walkthrough

### Input:
```plaintext
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
```

### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. **Iteration 1**:
   - `i = 0, num = 2, target = 9`
   - `x = 9 - 2 = 7`
   - `7` is not in the dictionary, so add `{2: 0}` to the dictionary.

2. **Iteration 2**:
   - `i = 1, num = 7, target = 9`
   - `x = 9 - 7 = 2`
   - `2` exists in the dictionary at index `0`.
   - Return `[0, 1]`.

### Output:
```plaintext
[0, 1]
```

## How to Run the Code

1. **Environment**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed (e.g., Python 3.6+).

2. **Input Format**:
   - Provide a list `nums` and an integer `target` as input.

3. **Run the Function**:
   - Use the `twoSum` function from the `Solution` class with your input.

---

## Common Questions

1. **Why use a dictionary?**
   - The dictionary helps us find if the complement of the current number exists in constant time, reducing the time complexity.

2. **What if there are multiple solutions?**
   - The problem guarantees one unique solution, so we don't handle multiple pairs.

3. **Can the same number be used twice?**
   - No, the indices must be distinct.

---

## Practice
Try running the code with these inputs:

1. `nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6`  
   **Output**: `[1, 2]`

2. `nums = [3, 3], target = 6`  
   **Output**: `[0, 1]`
